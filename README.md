> Automatically configures the hoodie release process.

Using this plugin it is possible to release a new version with just `grunt release`.

This will
- only release code that doesn't fail it's tests
- pull in the latest [hoodie-dotfiles](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-dotfiles)
- trigger a [release preparation](tasks/prepare-release.js) that generates a changelog as well as a [codename](tasks/codename.js) on (Travis)CI 
- publishes the new version to npm and GitHub releases

Here is an [example release](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-cli/releases/tag/v0.5.5).

Configure Travis to deploy to npm (`travis setup npm`) and specify deploy hooks:
in `.travis.yml`
```yml
[...]
before_install:
- npm install -g grunt-cli
before_deploy:
- grunt before-deploy
after_deploy:
- grunt after-deploy
[...]
```

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-release-hoodie --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-release-hoodie');
```

## The "release" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `release` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  release: {}
})
```

### Options

#### options.bump
Type: `Object`
Default value:
```
bump: {
  commitMessage: 'chore(release): v%VERSION%',
  files: ['package.json', 'bower.json'],
  commitFiles: [
    'package.json',
    'bower.json',
    'CHANGELOG.md',
    'dist/*'
  ],
  pushTo: 'origin master'
}
```

The options object that gets forwarded to the [grunt-bump](https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump) task.

#### options.tasks
Type: `Array<String>`
Default value: `['codename', 'changelog']`

A list of tasks that prepare files for the release commit.

Whether to pull in the default dotfiles or not.
